## Core Module

The core module is where we've put all of the code to run our sample app, that aren't required to
dive into a particular architecture. Inside this module you will find code for fetching and updating
preferences, as well as recording analytics events. You'll find the core Jetpack Compose code that
is used to display preferences UI, and you'll see that all of that code has been unit tested (and 
even includes some compose UI testing).
